# Simulathrone
Web app which allows you to create **simulations** customizable on the fly by adding different variables and "laws".

It has an **"AI" component** which acts as a simple **neural network** (with UI where you can change the amount of inputs, hidden layers and outputs) - but to train it you have to write your own code - see [example training code](evolution.js).
